# How CI Checks Work

A walkthrough of what that little green ✓ (or red ✗) next to a commit actually means, what triggers it, and how to read it when it's red. Aimed at first-time contributors who've never set up a GitHub Actions workflow before.

If you just want to know how to pass the checks, jump to [Section 7 — Practical daily workflow](#7-practical-daily-workflow). If you're debugging a red X, jump to [Section 8 — When a check fails](#8-when-a-check-fails).

---

## 1. The trigger chain

When you run `git push origin master`, here's what happens behind the scenes:

```
git push                           (you)
  → GitHub receives new commit <sha>
  → GitHub looks at .github/workflows/*.yml in that commit
  → Finds ci.yml with `on: push: branches: [master]`
  → Matches → queues a workflow run
  → Spins up a fresh ubuntu-latest VM
  → Runs the steps in your job
  → Reports each step's pass/fail back to GitHub
  → GitHub aggregates into a single "check status" on the commit
```

The `on:` block in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` is the subscription. It tells GitHub "wake me up when these events happen":

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [master, main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [master, main]
```

Two events trigger CI in this repo:

- a **push** to `master` or `main`
- a **pull request** targeting `master` or `main`

A push to a feature branch does not trigger CI. A PR from a feature branch into `master` does. This keeps runner minutes low while still gating everything that actually lands on `master`.

---

## 2. A "check" is a message, not a program

GitHub has a thing called the **Checks API**. Any external system (GitHub Actions, CircleCI, a custom bot) can post a "check" against a commit SHA with:

- a **name** (e.g., `build + audit + validator`)
- a **status** (`queued` / `in_progress` / `completed`)
- a **conclusion** (`success` / `failure` / `cancelled` / `skipped` / `neutral` / `timed_out` / `action_required`)
- optional logs, annotations, and a URL to a details page

GitHub Actions is just one producer of these check messages. When a workflow finishes, it calls the Checks API to post one check **per job** in the workflow. For `ci.yml` there's one job, so one check gets posted. The ✓ or ✗ you see next to the commit is GitHub rendering that one check.

---

## 3. The hierarchy: workflow → job → step

`ci.yml` defines:

```
workflow: "CI"
  job: "build + audit + validator"     ← one check posted for this job
    step 1: Checkout
    step 2: Setup Node.js
    step 3: Install dependencies       (npm ci)
    step 4: Build TypeScript           (npm run build)
    step 5: Audit skill coverage       (npm run audit:strict)
    step 6: Run wireframe-validator    (npm run test:wireframe)
    step 7: Run binding-validator      (npm run test:binding)
    step 8: Run title-extractor test   (npm run test:extract-title)
    step 9: Run layout-validator       (npm run test:layout)
    step 10: Run layout-grid suite     (npm run test:grid)
    step 11: Run slicer-defaults test  (npm run test:slicer)
    step 12: Audit skills vs schema    (npm run test:schema-docs)
    step 13: Run report-diff tests     (npm run test:report-diff)
```

Rules:

- If **any** step fails, the job fails, and the check is marked `failure`.
- Subsequent steps are **skipped** by default after a failure. (This is why the first v0.5.9 CI run showed `Build TypeScript` = failure and the later steps = skipped — the build never produced `dist/`, so there was nothing to audit.)
- If you had multiple jobs (say `build`, `audit`, `validate` as three separate jobs), GitHub would post **one check per job** and the commit page would show three separate lines. Splitting jobs lets them run in parallel and fail independently, but costs more runner minutes. One job with several steps is fine for a short workflow.

---

## 4. The aggregation: why you see a single ✓

On any commit page, PR page, or the branch list, GitHub shows an aggregate rollup of all checks for that commit:

| Icon | Aggregate state | What it means |
|---|---|---|
| ○ (empty circle) | No checks reported yet | Just pushed, runner hasn't started |
| 🟡 (yellow dot) | `in_progress` or `queued` | Runner is working, wait ~15–90s |
| ✓ (green check) | All checks succeeded | Merge-ready |
| ✗ (red X) | At least one failure | Click → Details → read logs |
| ⊘ (gray circle with line) | `cancelled` | You (or concurrency rule) cancelled |
| ⚠ (orange !) | `action_required` | Manual approval needed (e.g. PR from a fork) |

Clicking the icon opens a popup listing every check individually. Clicking "Details" on any line opens the full job view — that's where the step-by-step logs live. For this repo, with one job posting one check, the popup will just show the single `build + audit + validator` entry.

---

## 5. The concurrency rule

`ci.yml` includes:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

This means: if you push commit A and then push commit B before A's CI run finishes, GitHub **cancels** the in-progress run for A and starts a new one for B. You don't pay for CI cycles on code nobody's going to look at. If you see a gray circle on an older commit, this is usually why.

---

## 6. Branch protection (the gate vs the smoke alarm)

Here's a subtlety worth knowing: **by default, CI is informational, not enforcing.**

Without any extra configuration:

- A red X on `master` is cosmetic. The push already happened. Nothing rolls back.
- A PR with a red X can still be merged if somebody clicks the merge button.
- Somebody can `git push --no-verify` and skip the pre-commit hook, then push broken code to `master`, and the red X appears **after** the damage.

For the gate to actually enforce anything, you need **branch protection rules**, configured in:

**GitHub repo → Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules → Add rule**

For a branch name pattern of `master` (or `main`), the knobs that matter:

- ☑ **Require a pull request before merging** — stops direct-to-master pushes entirely. Everything must go through a PR.
- ☑ **Require status checks to pass before merging** — pick `build + audit + validator` from the dropdown. A PR with a red X cannot merge.
  - ☑ **Require branches to be up to date before merging** — forces rebase before merge, so the check ran against the exact code that will land on `master`.
- ☑ **Do not allow bypassing the above settings** — even admins can't merge red PRs.

Without these, the CI workflow is a smoke alarm with nobody wired to listen. With them, the red X actually blocks bad code from landing. If you're serious about the gate, turn protection on — it's free and takes 90 seconds to configure.

---

## 7. Practical daily workflow

Assuming branch protection is on:

```
1. Work on a feature branch
      git checkout -b feature/my-thing
      # edit files
      git add -A && git commit -m "feat: my thing"
      # pre-commit hook runs audit + validator locally (fast path)

2. Push the branch
      git push -u origin feature/my-thing

3. Open a PR into master on github.com
      → GitHub triggers ci.yml (on: pull_request)
      → Yellow dot appears on the PR within a few seconds
      → 15–90s later: green ✓ or red X

4. If green
      → "Merge" button is enabled
      → Merge the PR
      → GitHub triggers ci.yml again (on: push to master)
      → Green ✓ on the merge commit

5. If red
      → Click "Details" on the failing check
      → Read the step log
      → Fix, commit, push to the same branch
      → CI re-runs automatically
      → Loop until green
```

The pre-commit hook is your **local fast path**: the same audit + validator checks, running on your machine before the commit is even made, so you usually never see the red X at all. CI is the safety net for when somebody skips hooks (`--no-verify`) or forgot to install them (`npm run hooks:install`).

---

## 8. When a check fails

### Step 1: find which step failed

- Click the red ✗ on the commit row (or the "Checks" tab on a PR).
- In the popup, click **Details** on the failing check.
- You'll land on the job page with a collapsible list of steps. The failing step is expanded by default and marked with a red ✗.

### Step 2: read the log

Each step is a shell session on the runner. The log shows everything stdout and stderr. For this repo:

- **Build TypeScript fails** → look for lines starting with `error TS` (TypeScript compile errors) or `##[error]`. Usually a type mismatch in `src/`.
- **Audit skill coverage fails** → look for `MISSING (no backtick mention...)`. Every registered tool must have a backtick mention in at least one `skills/*.md` file. Add the mention, commit, push.
- **Wireframe validator fails** → look for `Suite result: X/N` where X < N. The failing cases are named (e.g., `Layout A — 5 KPI cards`). Check whether you touched `src/wireframe-validator.ts` or `scripts/test-wireframe-validator.js`.
- **Install dependencies fails** → usually a `package-lock.json` out of sync with `package.json`. Run `npm install --package-lock-only` locally, commit the lock, push.

### Step 3: reproduce locally

After `npm ci`, the CI job runs these commands:

```
npm run build
npm run audit:strict
npm run test:wireframe
npm run test:binding
npm run test:extract-title
npm run test:layout
npm run test:grid
npm run test:slicer
npm run test:schema-docs
npm run test:report-diff
```

Run the full set (plus the other suites and the public-safety audit) with the convenience script:

```
npm run test:all
```

If these all pass locally but CI is still red, the usual suspects are:

1. **Stale `dist/`** committed to the repo but drifted from `src/`. Delete `dist/`, run `npm run build`, `git add dist/`, commit.
2. **Case-sensitive import paths** — Linux (CI) cares, Windows/Mac don't. `import { Foo } from "./foo.js"` vs `"./Foo.js"` compiles locally but fails on Linux.
3. **`package-lock.json` out of sync** — run `npm install --package-lock-only`, commit the lock.
4. **Node version mismatch** — CI uses Node 20. If you're on 18 or 22 locally, subtle TS diagnostics may differ. Match with `nvm use 20` or similar.

### Step 4: advanced — fetch logs via the API

If you're working in a terminal and don't want to click through the GitHub UI, and you have the `gh` CLI installed:

```
gh run list --limit 5
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

That dumps only the failing step's log straight to your terminal. Very fast for tight iteration loops.

Without `gh` installed, you can hit the REST API directly:

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs?per_page=5
```

Every run has an `id` and a `conclusion`. Fetch `/actions/runs/<id>/jobs` for step-level status, and `/actions/jobs/<job-id>/logs` for the raw log (returns a redirect to a zip download). The `$GITHUB_TOKEN` can be a personal access token with `repo` scope for private repos, or omitted entirely for public repos.
